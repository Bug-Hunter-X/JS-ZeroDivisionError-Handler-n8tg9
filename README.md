This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: division by zero. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` offers a robust solution.  The `divide` function in `bug.js` correctly handles division by zero by throwing an error, but this practice should be consistently implemented throughout any application to avoid unexpected behavior.
